I had some issues with this error:
'...cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system...' when running 'tsc index.ts.

I managed to fix it after a few minutes.

Then I had an issue with gitHub credentials but Juan helped me out after I spent some minutes trying to fix it on my own. I needed to use a security token instead of my password.
